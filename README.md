# fizzbuzz

During the Pre-Course at Makers Academy I created a program as part of the well known Fizzbuzz challenge. The program would receive an integer between 1 to 100 and would return a result depending on that integer given.

This taught me the fundamentals of Test Driven Development and gave me the opportunity to use RSpec for the first time.
